- Many traits have fallback conditions when specific patterns aren't found
- The system creates a balanced rarity distribution with few ultra-rare items

This trait system follows a classic NFT rarity pyramid structure with approximately 40 different headgear types.

# The Royals NFT Eye Color Traits

Based on the documentation provided, here's a comprehensive overview of the eye color traits in The Royals NFT collection:

## Eye Color Mechanics

- Eye color is determined by the **last digit** of the block number (following the 654321 pattern)
- There are 10 standard eye colors (one for each possible last digit 0-9)
- Eye colors have a fairly even distribution across the collection
- Aliens are the only exception, having a special lime green eye color regardless of the last digit

## Eye Colors by Last Digit

| Last Digit | Eye Color | Rarity Count |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 0 | Orange | 1000 |
| 1 | Cyan | 998 |
| 2 | Green | 1001 |
| 3 | Yellow | 1000 |
| 4 | Grey | 1001 |
| 5 | Purple | 1000 |
| 6 | Blue | 997 |
| 7 | Fawn | 997 |
| 8 | Pink | 1001 |
| 9 | Red | 1002 |

## Distribution Analysis

- The eye color distribution is remarkably balanced compared to other traits
- All standard colors appear approximately 1,000 times in the collection
- The slight variations are likely due to the distribution of block number endings
- Red (last digit 9) appears most frequently with 1,002 occurrences
- Blue and Fawn (last digits 6 and 7) are the least common with 997 occurrences each

## Special Cases

- Aliens have a lime green eye color that overrides the standard eye color assignment
- This is the only documented exception to the last digit rule for eye colors
- The alien trait is determined by divisibility (block number divisible by 111 but not by 69 and 16)

This trait system creates a very even distribution across eye colors, unlike many other traits that have significant rarity differences.
