# The Royals NFT Headgear Traits Guide

## Basic Mechanics
- Headgear is determined by the **last digit** of the block number
- Each last digit has multiple trait options triggered by specific patterns
- All headgear has color determined by the **third digit** (fourth-to-last digit)
- Five special crown traits are extremely rare (specific block numbers)
