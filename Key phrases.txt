I understand you're interested in Digital Matter Theory, or DMT. This is a technology built on Bitcoin that uses blockchain data to create non-arbitrary digital assets.

digital matter
Digital Matter refers to digital assets that have properties similar to physical matterâ€”they are unique, scarce, and governed by the laws of Bitcoin's blockchain rather than arbitrary decisions.

bitcoin
Bitcoin provides the foundation for DMT. Its blockchain data is used to create digital assets with unique properties.

blockchain
The blockchain, particularly Bitcoin's, is central to DMT. It provides thermodynamically locked data that gives DMT assets their non-arbitrary nature.

on chain
DMT is fully on-chain. The scripts that generate DMT assets exist on the Bitcoin blockchain, using Bitcoin's own data fields to create unique assets.

ordinals
Ordinals inscribe data on individual satoshis. DMT leverages Bitcoin's blockchain data fields to create dynamic, non-arbitrary assets.

block data
DMT uses Bitcoin block data, particularly field 11 (the bits field) which changes every 2016 blocks during difficulty adjustments. This creates predictable but non-arbitrary patterns.


the royals
The Royals was one of the first major DMT collections, featuring traits like VR goggles, crowns, and unique backgrounds generated using Bitcoin's block data.

nat cats
NAT Cats was an early DMT collection that helped popularize the technology. NAT stands for Non-Arbitrary Token, which is what DMT creates.

privilege auth
Privilege Authorization is a technology used with DMT that allows creators to control minting parameters such as whitelist access, allocation amounts, and future block height launches.

block pad
The Block Pad is a minting interface for DMT that creates an interactive experience by revealing blocks available for minting. It adds friction while making the process memorable.

block drops
Block Drops is a concept for DMT that allows assets to be airdropped to specific communities or elements, offering a more efficient distribution method than traditional airdrops.

metaverse
DMT was developed with the metaverse in mind. It creates digital assets with physics-like properties that can be utilized in virtual worlds, games, and applications.

non arbitrary
Non-arbitrary means that DMT assets derive their properties from Bitcoin's blockchain data rather than from arbitrary artistic or developer decisions, making them resemble digital physics.

arbitrary
Traditional NFTs are considered arbitrary because their traits and properties are determined by creators. In contrast, DMT assets derive their properties from Bitcoin's blockchain data.

field 11
Field 11 is the bits field in Bitcoin blocks that DMT currently uses. It changes every 2016 blocks during difficulty adjustments, creating predictable but non-arbitrary patterns.

inscription
DMT uses inscriptions to place assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's data fields to create unique, non-arbitrary assets.

expand
DMT collections can expand naturally when block patterns reoccur, typically every 2016 blocks. This design creates a predictable, yet uncontrolled, supply growth.

m scribe
M Scribe is the platform that developed DMT and the surrounding technologies, including Block Pad and Privilege Authorization.
